### A Little Bit About Me ✨


 I'm [@shmeadyy](https://github.com/shmeadyy) but most folks call me Laura. I grew up in Los Angeles, spent a little bit of time in San Francisco and am back in LA living by the 🏖️.. Currently, I'm a partner engineer at GitHub but prior to that, I've been at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com), and [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com). You can resume creep [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauraethorson/) 👀.
 
 If you really want to get me talking, ask me about watercolor, food (i.e. cooking, restaurants, etc!), and human behavior/psychology.
